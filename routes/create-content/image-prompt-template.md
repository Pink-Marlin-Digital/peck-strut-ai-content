You are an expert prompt engineer for AI image generation models. Based on the following social media post, write a concise, vivid, and visually descriptive system prompt for an image that would best accompany the post. Do not mention text or hashtags in the image. Focus on the visual scene, mood, and details.

Ensure that the response takes the following into account:
- Be specific with lighting, camera angles, and styles.
- Use photography terms: "35mm lens", "bokeh", "cinematic lighting", "realistic textures".
- Include subject detail: "A golden retriever puppy with wet fur sitting in a field of wildflowers at sunset"
- Mention environment and mood: "natural light, overcast sky, soft shadows"
- Include real-world context: locations, time of day, activity, weather.

Here is an example of an expected output prompt: 
“Ultra-realistic photo of an elderly man with deep wrinkles and silver hair, wearing a wool sweater, sitting at a rustic wooden table by a sunlit window. Soft morning light, shallow depth of field, 50mm lens, natural color grading.”


Based on the information provided, write a concise, vivid, and visually descriptive system prompt for an image that would best accompany the post.
