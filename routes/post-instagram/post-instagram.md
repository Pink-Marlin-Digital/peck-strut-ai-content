|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` | Facebook App ID (if using Facebook Graph API) | Facebook Developer Console |
| `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` | Facebook App Secret (if using Facebook Graph API) | Facebook Developer Console |

### How to Obtain Environment Variables

#### Step 1: Create a Facebook App

1. Go to [Facebook Developer Console](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Click "Create App" and select "Business" as the app type
3. Fill in your app details and create the app
4. Note down your **App ID** and **App Secret** (you'll need these)

#### Step 2: Connect Instagram Business Account

1. In your Facebook App, go to "Add Product" and add "Instagram Basic Display" or "Instagram Graph API"
2. Navigate to "Instagram Basic Display" ‚Üí "Basic Display" ‚Üí "Instagram App ID"
3. Connect your Instagram Business Account to the app
4. You'll need to have an Instagram Business Account (not a personal account)

#### Step 3: Get Instagram Business Account ID

1. Go to [Facebook Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
2. Select your app from the dropdown
3. Use this query to get your Instagram Business Account ID:
   ```
   GET /me/accounts
   ```
4. Look for the Instagram Business Account in the response and note the `id` field

#### Step 4: Generate Access Token

1. In Graph API Explorer, select your app and Instagram Business Account
2. Add the following permissions:
   - `instagram_basic`
   - `instagram_content_publish`
   - `pages_read_engagement`
3. Generate the access token
4. **Important**: Convert to a long-lived token (valid for 60 days) or use a page access token

#### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required
INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here
INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_instagram_business_account_id_here

# Optional (if using Facebook Graph API)
INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id_here
INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret_here
```

### Token Management

- **Access Token Expiry**: Long-lived tokens expire after 60 days
- **Token Refresh**: You'll need to refresh tokens periodically
- **Security**: Never commit tokens to version control
- **Permissions**: Ensure tokens have the required permissions listed below

### Required Permissions

Your Instagram Business Account needs these permissions:
- `instagram_basic`: Read basic account information
- `instagram_content_publish`: Publish content to Instagram
- `pages_read_engagement`: Read page engagement data

## Implementation Details

### Instagram API Integration

The route integrates with Instagram's Graph API to:
- Upload images from URLs to Instagram's servers
- Create posts with custom captions
- Handle authentication via access tokens
- Manage rate limits and API quotas

### Image Processing

- **URL Validation**: Validates that the provided image URL is accessible
- **Format Support**: Supports common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- **Size Limits**: Handles Instagram's image size and format requirements
- **Download & Upload**: Downloads image from URL and uploads to Instagram

### Error Handling

The route includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid or inaccessible image URLs
- Instagram API authentication failures
- Rate limiting and quota exceeded errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid image formats or sizes

## Testing

A Postman collection is provided at `post-instagram.postman_collection.json` with example requests for testing the endpoint.

### Test Example

```javascript
// Example test request
const response = await fetch('/post-instagram', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    description: 'Test post from API! üì∏ #test #api',
    imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/1080/1080'
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

## Dependencies

- `fastify`: Web framework
- `axios`: HTTP client for image downloads and Instagram API calls
- `sharp`: Image processing library
- `fs`: File system operations for temporary image storage

## Security Considerations

- Instagram credentials are stored in environment variables
- Access tokens should have appropriate permissions (instagram_basic, instagram_content_publish)
- Input validation prevents malicious URL injection
- Temporary image files are cleaned up after upload
- Rate limiting should be implemented to prevent API abuse

## Performance Notes

- Image downloads may take time depending on URL and file size
- Instagram API has rate limits that should be respected
- Consider implementing image caching for repeated uploads
- Temporary file storage should be managed efficiently

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Instagram credentials not configured"**
   - Check that all required environment variables are set
   - Verify token hasn't expired

2. **"Failed to download image"**
   - Ensure image URL is accessible
   - Check image format is supported (JPEG, PNG)

3. **"Media processing failed"**
   - Instagram may reject images that don't meet their requirements
   - Ensure image is appropriate content for Instagram

4. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Instagram has strict rate limits
   - Implement delays between posts

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
